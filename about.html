        <h1 id="text">Welcome to the ELECTRONIQ about us page!</h1>
        <p id="text">Welcome to ELECTRONIQ! I am here to assist you with all your technology-related queries and issues. If you need help with troubleshooting, software installation, or anything else tech-related, feel free to ask. Additionally, I aim to help our users enhance their coding skills. If you're interested in learning how to code, simply drop me a message, and I will arrange a personalized Google Meet session. However, please note that I can only meet one person at a time for the Google Meet session due to limited resources. Therefore, we kindly request your patience and understanding.</p>
